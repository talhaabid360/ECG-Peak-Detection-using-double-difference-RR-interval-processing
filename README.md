# ECG-Peak-Detection-using-double-difference-RR-interval-processing

This is a practical implementation for paper automatic R-peak detection in single lead digital ECG data. The three-stage process involves sorting 
and thresholding the squared double difference signal for QRS regions, comparing relative magnitudes to approximate R-peaks, and performing RR interval processing for accurate peak detection.
